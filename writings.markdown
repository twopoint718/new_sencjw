# Writings

I've done a fair amount of writing on other topics and in other blogs.  I've
collected a list of those here. Many are invited guest author posts or are from
Bendyworks' blog. If you've liked what I've said so far, then go check these
out:

* [X Marks the Spot](https://8thlight.com/blog/tags/reason.html):
  A three-part series on why application programmers should consider using [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) for business apps.
  There's a focus on how ReasonReact is a better ReactJS experience than ReactJS is -- due to features like static types and named parameters.
* [Applicative Validation - or - Rails Validation Considered
  Weird](http://www.functionalruby.com/blog/2013/08/17/applicative-validation-or-rails-validation-considered-weird/):
  written for "Functional Ruby." An article where I imagine what Rails would
  look like if it used applicative-style validation instead of pushing things
  onto an `errors` hash.
* [Craftsman Swap
  Podcast](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/5/craftsman-swap-podcast):
  Devin and I were interviewed on the [Relevance
  podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/05/22/thinkrelevance-the-podcast-episode-012-craftsman-swap)
  talking about [Craftsman
  swaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)
* [George Boole Returned as a Zombie and is Gnawing on My
  Brain](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/2/george-boole-returned-as-a-zombie-and-is-gnawing-on-my-brain):
  I suggest that introducing richer boolean operators in languages my help to
  clean up complex logical statements. In particular, [material
  implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional) is a
  neglected, but really useful, operation.
* [Cthulhuian Document Preparation With
  Troff](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/10/cthulhuian-document-preparation-with-troff):
  I discuss how to use the UNIX tool, `troff`.
* [Don't Say  'Emacs' or
  'Vi'](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/9/don-t-say-emacs-or-vi):
  What is your favorite editor *besides* Emacs or Vi? Do you have one? Back
  when you started programming, what did you use? In this short listicle, I
  talk about four editors, sorted in [autobiographical
  order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQvOnDlql5g).
* [Getting Plan 9 Running on the Raspberry
  Pi](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/lab_projects/2012/11/getting-plan-9-running-on-the-raspberry-pi):
  Combining my love for [Plan 9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/) with my
  attraction to small PCs, this article is a HOWTO for getting Plan 9 to run on
  the RasPi. This is a perennially popular article because it's linked from the
  [Plan 9 from Bell Labs Wikipedia
  page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs). People around the
  office are jelly at my link karma here.
* [Styleguide Rails](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2013/2/styleguide-rails):
  I describe the benefits of [Joe Nelson's](http://begriffs.com/) *Styleguide Rails* gem.
* [From Ruby to Haskell, Part 1:
  Testing](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2012/12/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-1-testing):
  this post kicks off my epic Haskell *N-ology* by talking about what Ruby
  programmers would find very familiar about testing in Haskell. It also talks
  about some things that Ruby programmers would find very unfamiliar,
  property-based testing.
* [From Ruby to Haskell, Part 2: Similarity, Refactoring, and
  Patterns](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2013/4/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-2-similarity-refactoring-and-patterns):
  in this part in the series, I talk about how being lazy, pure, and functional
  make for some really sweet refactoring. I also talk about a common and useful
  structure in Haskell, the
  [monoid](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monoid).
* [From Ruby to Haskell, Part 3: Lazy
  Evaluation](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2014/1/from-ruby-to-haskell-part-3-lazy-evaluation):
  this part in the series talks about all of the nice benefits that one gets
  from laziness, or *non-strict evaluation* and how, even if you think you
  don't, you probably do use it frequently in Ruby.
* [What can SQL do for
  you?](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2013/11/what-can-sql-do-for-you)
  this is a writeup of my guest blog post for [the
  Changelog](http://thechangelog.com) entitled: [Rails and SQL's Relationship
  Status: "It's
  Complicated"](http://thechangelog.com/rails-and-sql-relationship-status/)
  where I describe my open source gem, [Reactive
  Record](https://github.com/twopoint718/reactive_record). After reading this,
  I suggest you go and take a look at the paper [Out of the Tar
  Pit](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E249C27DBC65E10E8E465AC6888CF6C9?doi=10.1.1.93.8928&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
  by Ben Moseley and Peter Marks. The system they describe is what I,
  unknowingly, am getting at.
* [Lists out of Lambdas and Boxes out of
  Functions](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2013/4/lists-out-of-lambdas-and-boxes-out-of-functions):
  I riff on [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and
  show how code and data really are two different views of the same thing.
* [The Migrationless
  Migration](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2014/1/the-migrationless-migration):
  This article talks about how actual database tables could be hidden through
  the use of database views. Application code could be made unaware of the
  underlying schema of the database.
