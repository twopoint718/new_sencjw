# The Transparent Web

## Bridging the Chasm in Web Development

*The Transparent Web* is a book that I’m writing about some The

client-side code that we’re all used to writing.

### Frameworks

 * [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
 * [Opa](http://opalang.org/)
 * [Ur/Web](http://www.impredicative.com/ur/)
 * [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
