# The Transparent Web

## Bridging the Chasm in Web Development

*The Transparent Web* (working title) is a book that I'm writing about some
"next-generation" web frameworks that seek to abstract away repetitive,
*low-level* details of web applications. Whether those details are separate
client/server components or all the HTML/CSS/JS needed for a pleasing
user-interface, The Transparent Web will show you how you can write
simpler, higher-level, and safer apps today!

### Frameworks

 * [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
 * [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
 * [Opa](http://opalang.org/)
 * [Ur/Web](http://www.impredicative.com/ur/)
 * [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

### Presentations

Please see [talks](talks.html) for a list of all the talks I've given.

### The Book

*Update* **The Transparent Web** is now a real tree-and-glue book.

The book is forthcoming from [Manning Publications](http://manning.com/)
next year. Stay tuned if you're interested in checking it out early on
[MEAP](http://manning.com/about/meap). I'll be sure to provide all the
details you need.
