# Interviews

I've been on a few interviews and podcasts.

* [Relevance
  podcast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2012/05/22/thinkrelevance-the-podcast-episode-012-craftsman-swap):
  Devin and I were interviewed about doing [craftsman
  swaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) between
  [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) and [Relevance (now
  Cognitect)](http://cognitect.com/).
* [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/075-rr-open-source-licenses/): I was
  interviewed about various software licenses and what they're all about.
  (Spoiler: I play the GPL/AGPL part)
