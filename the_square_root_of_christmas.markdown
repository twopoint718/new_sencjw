# The Square Root of Christmas

## March 5th is the Square Root of Christmas.

I just wanted to make the announcement, if anyone happened to be
unaware. The reason for the holiday, if you haven’t guessed already, is
because sqrt(1225) = 35. Translating those numbers into calendar dates
gives us the square root of Christmas 12/25 falling on 3/5. It just so
happens that there is another big nerd holiday in March, Pi Day (3/14).
Why not connect these two dates with a week(ish) long nerd celebration?
I hereby declare that:

 * March 5th shall be known as the Square Root of Christmas
 * The 10-day interval between the Square Root of Christmas and Pi Day shall be known as Nerdigras
