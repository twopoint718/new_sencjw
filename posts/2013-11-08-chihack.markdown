As I continue my leisurely foray into the world of Haskell, I have
come upon a bivouac of Haskellers near Chicago this weekend. Myself
and a co-worker from the office will be attending the first-ever
[ChiHack](https://plus.google.com/events/cc4njkf8kh5aho6soboisv6c7rc).
Maybe I can get someone to explain
[Backpack](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~skilpat/backpack/) to me.
