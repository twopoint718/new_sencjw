*Google+ is another Facebook*.  It may be nice but we should all remember that it is basically the same thing.  That may be a positive or a negative for you, but the same conversation that we've been having about Facebook applies to Google+.  If we want to network with people, perhaps it is worthwhile to consider existing tools.  Blogs for general sharing (blogs that live on your own server!), email for 1-to-1 correspondence, IRC for chat and so on.  You don't need a third party to mediate your relationships.
