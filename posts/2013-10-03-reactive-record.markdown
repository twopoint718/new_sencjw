title: reactive_record
---


Just wanted to make a quick note that I have published my first gem,
[reactive_record](https://rubygems.org/gems/reactive_record), on
rubygems. It is a utility that lets you "export" constraints from
your existing postgres database, creating Rails models.

It is pretty early, but I have put in a lot of work and I hope that
it is useful for your projects.
