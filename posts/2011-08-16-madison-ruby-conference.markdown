title: Madison Ruby Conference
---

I'm going to be attending the [Madison Ruby Conference](http://madisonruby.org) this Friday and Saturday.  I must confess that I'm not a Ruby-ista (does this reveal my *pythonista* heritage?) by training but I'm really excited to go and see who attends, chat with smart tech-folk, and generally have a good nerd-time yakking about code.  Plus, it couldn't hurt to see a little ruby code and see what all the fuss is about.  I'm not going to confine myself to: C, Java, Python, Lisp, Haskell, and shell. Conference Ahoy.
