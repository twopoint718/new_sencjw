title: Feynman Understands Programming
---

Watch this video of Feynman explaining how he does physics work.
Programming works the same way!

Here's the translation key: replace "theory" with "a potential program that
solves my problem." And replace "consequences of the theory" with either
the correct operation of the program or of bugs (as revealed by tests
breaking). All the intervening layers of software make it hard to *really*
know what's going on. The best that we can hope for is, like Feynman
explains, "qualitative understanding" of what the program should do. Before
we can write programs, we have to have an idea of what we expect that
program to do. Critically, we also have to have an idea of *if* that
expectation were true (or false) *what other things would we expect to
see?* Programming is hard because we have to envision these other phantom
worlds and treat them as equally real until we know they aren't.

Stay tuned for when he begins talking about how important unbroken
stretches of time are for working on (programming). Feynman's solution is
to cultivate an aura of *irresponsibility* so that he'll have time to do
physics.
