We're doing a [Haskell
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Madison-Haskell-Users-Group/) in Madison! I'm
really eager to see what comes out of this. I remember that I first heard
about Bendyworks because of a Clojure meetup. Getting a bunch of
like-minded people together will be fun. Besides, maybe I can find some
more people to blab to about free monads.
