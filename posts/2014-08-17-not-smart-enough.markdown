title: Writing code that I'm not smart enough to write
---

I gave a short talk this week on my trip to [Lambda
Jam](http://www.lambdajam.com/) a few weeks ago. The topic grew out of a
programming exercise/talk given by [Runar
Bjarnason](https://a.confui.com/-cv6PWx31) called "Let's make a programming
language."

This talk is about how I was able (with some help) to write code that I
didn't really know how to write. It's an enlightening experience when you
can *figure out* code just by exploring and reasoning. It's been one of the
reasons why, even when I find it tough or confusing, that functional
programming has continued to draw me in.
