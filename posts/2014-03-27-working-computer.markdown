title: A Working Computer
---

Just thought that I'd make a tiny little post here and mention that I got
my [nand2tetris][n2t] computer up and running. That is, I finished off the
CPU (which has some tricky parts) and connected it up to the 32K ROM and
the Memory (also screen and keyboard memory maps).

I'm now at the point where I can begin implementing the software stack that
the platform uses. I've started out by writing the assembler in Haskell.
We'll see how this goes.

If this is the first you're hearing about nand2tetris, and if additionally,
you enjoy hardware-y sorts of things, then I can't recommend this course
enough. It has been like a light going on in my head for understanding how
these [silly little computers][feynman] all around us work!
